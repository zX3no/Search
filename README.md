    - Database

- Database
    - Radix Tree
        - Paths
    - File Name
    - Metadata
        - File size
        - Last changed
        - Is directory
    
    A wrapper around the database for threading reasons?

- Indexer

    Writes database to file.
    Why have indexer and database?

- Watcher
