### Design

```
UI <--> DATABASE <--> INDEXER 
           ^
 â €         |
        Watcher
 ```

- UI
    - Query
    - Selection
    - Database

- Database
    - Radix Tree
    
    A wrapper around the database for threading reasons?
    I don't really want to hold the metadata since it's slow to get,
    maybe the UI can just ask for it?
    It's not like I'm showing all the items at once.
    How would you order by filesize then?
- Watcher

    Append files to the database when new files are made.

    Delete files to the database when they are deleted.
